### Glad to see you here!

I’m a final-year Computer Science student focused on **cloud-native DevOps engineering**.  
I enjoy building production-style infrastructure, automating workflows, and solving reliability problems using containers, cloud platforms, and CI/CD pipelines.

### Talking about Personal Stuffs:

- 🛠 &nbsp; Currently working on **DevOps projects** involving AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD, and FastAPI-based backend services.
- 🚀 &nbsp; Learning **Terraform best practices**, EKS internals, and production reliability concepts.
- 🤝 &nbsp; Open to collaborating on **DevOps, cloud infrastructure, automation, and open-source** projects.
- 💬 &nbsp; Ask me about Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD pipelines, FastAPI basics, or C++.
- ☕ &nbsp; Fun fact: Most of my debugging happens late at night, powered by music and caffeine.

### My Core Interests:

- ☁️ &nbsp; Cloud infrastructure & container orchestration  
- ⚙️ &nbsp; Automation, CI/CD, and DevOps tooling  
- 🧠 &nbsp; Learning how production systems actually fail (and how to fix them)
